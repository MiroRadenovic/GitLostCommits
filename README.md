GitLostCommits
==============

IronPython script used to retrieve a list of missing commits between branches.
The compare is made only through a regex from commit's subject. No commit's SHA1 is used.

The script is usefull only for a particular project. If you need to compare branches by commit's messages, this  script can be usefulll for you, other wise use git commands to compare commits (using sha1) between branches
